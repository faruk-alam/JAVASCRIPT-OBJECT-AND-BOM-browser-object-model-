Creating a String from an Array:

There may be situations where you simply want to create a string by joining the elements of
an array. To do this you can use the join() method.This method takes an optional parameter
which is a separator string that is added in between each element.If you omit the separator,
then JavaScript will use comma (,) by default.
we can also convert an array to a comma-separated string using the toString().This method 
does not accept the separator parameter like join().

Dialog/pop up Boxes:
In JavaScript you can create dialog boxes or popups to interact with the user. You can either use them to notify a 
user or to receive some kind of user input before proceeding.

Creating Alert Dialog Boxes
An alert dialog box is the most simple dialog box. It enables you to display a short message to the user. It also 
includes OK button, and the user has to click this OK button to continue.
You can create alert dialog boxes with the alert() method.

Creating Prompt Dialog Box
The prompt dialog box is used to prompt the user to enter information. A prompt dialog box includes a text input 
field, an OK and a Cancel button.
You can create prompt dialog boxes with the prompt() method. This method returns the text entered in the input 
field when the user clicks the OK button, and null if user clicks the Cancel button. If the user clicks OK button 
without entering any text, an empty string is returned. For this reason, its result is usually assigned to a 
variable when it is used.

The Location Object
The location property of a window (i.e. window.location) is a reference to a Location object; it represents 
the current URL of the document being displayed in that window.

Since window object is at the top of the scope chain, so properties of the window.location object can be 
accessed without window. prefix, for example window.location.href can be written as location.href. The 
following section will show you how to get the URL of page as well as hostname, protocol, etc. using the 
location object property of the window object.

Getting the Current Page URL
You can use the window.location.href property to get the entire URL of the current page.
Getting Different Part of a URL
Similarly, you can use other properties of the location object such as protocol, hostname, port, pathname, 
search, etc. to obtain different part of href.

Loading New Documents
You can use the assign() method of the location object i.e. window.location.assign() to load another resource from 
a URL provided as parameter.
You can also use the replace() method to load new document which is almost the same as assign(). The difference is 
that it doesn't create an entry in the browser's history, meaning the user won't be able to use the back button 
to navigate to it.

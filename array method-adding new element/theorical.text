Adding New Elements to an Array:

To add a new element at the end of an array, simply use the push() method,
Similarly, to add a new element at the beginning of an array use the unshift() method,
You can also add multiple elements at once using the push() and unshift() methods.
The JavaScript array concat() method combines two or more arrays and returns a new string. 
This method doesn't make any change in the original array.

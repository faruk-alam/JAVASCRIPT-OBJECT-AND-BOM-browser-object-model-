Extracting a Portion of an Array:

If we want to extract out a portion of an subarray but keep the original 
array intact you can use the slice() method. This method takes 2 parameters: start index 
(index at which to begin extraction), and an optional end index (index before which to end 
extraction), syntax:

 arr.slice(startIndex, endIndex). 

If endIndex parameter is omitted, all elements to the end of the array are extracted. You 
can also specify negative indexes or offsets â€”in that case the slice() method extract the 
elements from the end of an array, rather then the begining.

JavaScript is a prototype-based language that facilitates the objects to acquire properties and features 
from one another. Here, each object contains a prototype object.
In JavaScript, whenever a function is created the prototype property is added to that function 
automatically. This property is a prototype object that holds a constructor property.
What is the requirement of a prototype object?
Whenever an object is created in JavaScript, its corresponding functions are loaded into memory. So, a new 
copy of the function is created on each object creation.

In a prototype-based approach, all the objects share the same function. This ignores the requirement of 
creating a new copy of function for each object. Thus, the functions are loaded once into the memory.

Prototype Inheritance
In JavaScript, a prototype can be used to add properties and methods to a constructor function. And objects 
inherit properties and methods from a prototype

Add Methods to a Constructor Function Using Prototype
You can also add new methods to a constructor function using prototype

Adding or Removing Elements at Any Position:

The splice() method is a very versatile array method that allows us to add or remove elements
from any index, using the syntax:
 arr.splice(startIndex, deleteCount, elem1, ..., elemN).

This method takes three parameters: the first parameter is the index at which to start 
splicing the array, it is required; the second parameter is the number of elements to 
remove (use 0 if we don't want to remove any elements), it is optional; and the third 
parameter is a set of replacement elements, it is also optional.

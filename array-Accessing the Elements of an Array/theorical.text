Accessing the Elements of an Array:

Array elements can be accessed by their index using the square bracket notation. An index 
is a number that represents an element's position in an array.
Array indexes are zero-based. This means that the first item of an array is stored at 
index 0, not 1, the second item is stored at index 1, and so on. Array indexes start at 0 
and go up to the number of elements minus 1. So, array of five elements would have indexes 
from 0 to 4.

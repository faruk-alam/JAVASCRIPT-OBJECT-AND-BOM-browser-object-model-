Searching Through an Array:

If you want to search an array for a specific value, you can simply use the indexOf() and 
lastIndexOf(). If the value is found, both methods return an index representing the array 
element. If the value is not found, -1 is returned. The indexOf() method returns the first 
one found, whereas the lastIndexOf() returns the last one found.
